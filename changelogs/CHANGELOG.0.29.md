# Release 0.29.0

## What's New

### Deprecated Binary Removal
This release removes the following deprecated binaries from the release archives.

* `ziti-controller` - replaced by `ziti controller`
* `ziti-router`     - replaced by `ziti router`
* `ziti-tunnel`     - replaced by `ziti tunnel`

The release archives now only contain the `ziti` executable. This executable is now at the root of the archive instead of nested under a `ziti` directory.

### Ziti CLI Demo Consolidation

The ziti CLI functions under `ziti learn`, namely `ziti learn demo` and `ziti learn tutorial` have been consolidated under `ziti demo`.

### Continued Quickstart Changes

The quickstart continues to evolve. A breaking change has occurred as numerous environment variables used to customize the quickstart
have changed again. A summary of changes is below

* All `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_` variables have been changed to just `ZITI_ROUTER_`.
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_NAME` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_NAME`
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_PORT` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_PORT`
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_HOST` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_HOST`
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_IP_OVERRIDE` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_IP_OVERRIDE`
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_ENROLLMENT_DURATION` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_ENROLLMENT_DURATION`
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_HOST` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_HOST`
  * `ZITI_EDGE_ROUTER_LISTENER_BIND_PORT` -> `ZITI_ROUTER_LISTENER_BIND_PORT`
* Additional variables have been added to support "alternative addresses" and "alternative PKI", for example
  to support using Let's Encrypt certificates easily in the quickstarts.
* New variables were introduced to allow automatic generation of the `alt_server_certs` section. Both variables
  must be supplied for the variables to impact the configurations.
  * `ZITI_PKI_ALT_SERVER_CERT` - "Alternative server certificate. Must be specified with ZITI_PKI_ALT_SERVER_KEY"
  * `ZITI_PKI_ALT_SERVER_KEY` - "Key to use with the alternative server certificate. Must be specified with ZITI_PKI_ALT_SERVER_CERT"
* New variables were introduced to allow one to override and customize the CSR section of routers which is used during enrollment.
  * `ZITI_ROUTER_CSR_C` - "The country (C) to use for router CSRs"
  * `ZITI_ROUTER_CSR_ST` - "The state/province (ST) to use for router CSRs"
  * `ZITI_ROUTER_CSR_L` - "The locality (L) to use for router CSRs"
  * `ZITI_ROUTER_CSR_O` - "The organization (O) to use for router CSRs"
  * `ZITI_ROUTER_CSR_OU` - "The organization unit to use for router CSRs"
  *	`ZITI_ROUTER_CSR_SANS_DNS` - "The DNS name used in the CSR request"
* New variable `ZITI_CTRL_EDGE_BIND_ADDRESS` allows controlling the IP the edge API uses
