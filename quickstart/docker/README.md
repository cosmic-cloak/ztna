# Building and Deploying the Latest Quickstart Docker Image

==========================

First, decide what you are trying to do. Are you trying to:

* build a `ziti` from source, bake it into a docker image, and run the docker container?
* dev on the scripts inside the docker container, or the Dockerfile/compose file?
* build an 'older' version of `ziti` into a docker image to run

## Build Docker Image for Local Dev

------------------

1. change to this directory from checkout root: `cd quickstart/docker`
1. run the script `./createLocalImage.sh --build` which will create a `openziti/quickstart:latest` tag
   using the `ziti` CLI located in `./image/ziti-bin`
   1. Optionally, you may provide an argument for the image tag. `./createLocalImage.sh --build <tagname>`

## Build Docker Image for Docker-related Changes

1. change to this directory from checkout root: `cd quickstart/docker`
1. run the script `./createLocalImage.sh` which will create a `openziti/quickstart:latest` tag
   using the latest `ziti` [release from GitHub](https://github.com/cosmic-cloak/ztna/releases/latest)
   1. Optionally, you may provide an argument, e.g., `./createLocalImage.sh <tagname>`, to create a tag
      other than `latest`.

## Build Docker Image with Specific ziti Version

1. change to this directory from checkout root: `cd quickstart/docker`
1. set `ZITI_VERSION_OVERRIDE` to a version >= 0.29.0 (prior versions used a different build path)
1. run the script `ZITI_VERSION_OVERRIDE=0.29.0 ./createLocalImage.sh` which will create a `openziti/quickstart:latest` tag
   using the specified version of `ziti` [from GitHub](https://github.com/cosmic-cloak/ztna/releases/tag/v0.29.0)
   1. Optionally, you may provide an argument, e.g., `ZITI_VERSION_OVERRIDE=0.29.0 ./createLocalImage.sh <tagname>`, to create a tag
      other than `latest`.

## Build Docker Image For Publication

To publish the latest `ziti` CLI, use [the GitHub Action](https://github.com/cosmic-cloak/ztna/actions/workflows/push-quickstart.yml).
It's preferable to use `main` as the branch to create the docker image from, but it's
perfectly fine to use 'release-next' as the source if there are script-related changes that need
to be pushed out faster than waiting for a merge to main.
